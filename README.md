A simple shell script to launch new containers and configure the basic settings

What it does
- Ask for a container name and launch the container
- Install openssh and copy ssh key files
- Install Urbackupclient and some basic tools


What is still missing
- Configuration for some standard settings, that are currently hardcoded: Container OS, ssh key location
